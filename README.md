# 09 Node.js Challenge: Professional README Generator

## Description
My motivation was to create a dynamic README file based off what the user inputs. Why I built this project was to be able to easily create a README file based off parameters that I set up. The problem I solved was being able to save time by having a easily intergrating a list of questions that generate a README file easily . What I learned was how to use JavaScript with Node.js. 

## Installation: 
Clone the remote repository or zip the file to your local respository.  
Then the application will be invoked by using the following command in the terminal:

```bash
node index.js
```
